/**
 * Base class for an actor publishing events.
 *
 * Concrete subclasses must implement [[receiveEvent]] which becomes part of
 * the initial behavior, i.e. gets called by the provided [[receive]] implementation. Typically `receiveEvent` would
 * be implemented simply be invoking [[onEvent]] which fist appends the received event (message) to the buffer which
 * is limited by the `bufferSize` paramete – old events are discarded – and then publishes the buffered events up to the
 * total demand if this publisher is active.
 *
 * `ActorPublisherMessage.Request` is handled by publishing the buffered events up to the requested demand and
 * other `ActorPublisherMessage`s (e.g. `Cancel`) stop this actor.
 *
 * If the `heartbeatInterval` is defined, a [[ServerSentEvent.heartbeat]] will be published if no other event has
 * been received within that interval.
 *
 * '''Attention''': An implicit view `A => ServerSentEvent` has to be in scope!
 *
 * @param bufferSize the maximum number of events (messages) to be buffered
 * @param heartbeatInterval the interval for heartbeats; if `Undefined`, which is the default, no heartbeats are
 *                          published
